## Education
- **`[2024]`** MSc in Computational Finance, *Department of Mathematics - University of Padua* (in progress)
- **`[2023]`** BSc in [Computer Science](autocertificazione_informatica.pdf), *Department of Computer Science - University of Pisa* (summa cum laude `110L/110`)
- **`[2011]`** BEng in [Mechanical Engineering](autocertificazione_ingegneria.pdf), *Department of Industrial Engineering - University of Pisa* (not completed)




## Programming & Software
- **`LANGUAGES`** *C/C++*, *Java*, *Python*, *JavaScript*, *Go*, *Scheme*, *OCaml*, *Haskell*, *Bash*, *AWK*
- **`UNIX`** *GNU/Linux* and *BSD* system management, *C* system programming and good knowledge of the *POSIX* standard
- **`TOOLS`** Experience with various software such as *Vim*, *Emacs*, *Git*, *LaTeX*, *MATLAB* and *Wolfram Mathematica*
- **`EXTRA`** Knowledge of *SQL*, *HTML* and *CSS*




## Relevant Experience
- [**`TOODY`**](https://github.com/matteogiorgi/toody) *Python* web application for the detection of variability indicators in requirements documents of software systems, written for my BSc thesis. The application uses *Spacy* for *NLP* analysis and *Flask* for the web interface.
- [**`LAB-ASSISTANT`**](http://didawiki.di.unipi.it/doku.php/fisica/informatica/201617/start) Worked, in support of Professor Pelagatti, as lab assistant for the *C* laboratory exam at BSc in Physics at the *University of Pisa*. The main task was to help students during the exercise sessions and to correct their assignments.
- **`CNR-PROJECT`** Worked, together with a colleague of mine, as a *Python* programmer inside the *CNR* offices in Pisa, helping in the realization of a scale model for blind people. The project was under the supervision of Doctor Furfari from *CNR* and Professor Pelagatti from the *University of Pisa*.
- **`PDE`****`[`**[**`BASE`**](https://github.com/matteogiorgi/pde-base)**`/`**[**`PLUG`**](https://github.com/matteogiorgi/pde-plug)**`/`**[**`TILE`**](https://github.com/matteogiorgi/pde-tile)**`]`** Public repositories containing a collection of configuration files and installation scripts for a complete and efficient *UNIX* work environment based on any *Debian* distribution.
- [**`ASTEROIDS`**](https://github.com/matteogiorgi/asteroids) *JavaScript* implementation of the popular game *Asteroids*. The game is written using the *p5.js* library and is particularly useful to understand the basics of *Event Programming*.
- [**`RSA-REPORT`**](https://github.com/matteogiorgi/wiener) Independent studies, under the supervision of Professor Romani from the *University of Pisa*, regarding the attacks that exploit the *RSA* cryptosystem vulnerabilities with a specific focus on the *Wiener Attack* and its use of *Continued Fractions* for the factorization of the *RSA* module.
- [**`HACKATHON`**](http://contaminationlab.unipi.it/conthackt-foodmobilitydigital) First place in the 2021 edition of *ContHackt*, organized by the *University of Pisa* and *Contamination Lab Pisa*. As winner, our team had access to the 2021/2022 *EUAcceL* project organized by the *European Institute of Innovation and Technology* and won the final stage with a blockchain prototype for the tracking of food products.




## Languages
- **`ENGLISH`** Advanced proficiency in speaking and writing, *Cambridge C1 Advanced (IELTS 7.0)* certification
- **`FRENCH`** Basic understanding in speaking and writing, *DELF A2* certification
- **`ITALIAN`** Mother tongue




## Areas of Interest
- Being a student of *Computational Finance*, I am particularly interested in *Numerical Approximation* and *Mathematical Programming*. Specifically *Stochastic Optimization* and its applications in the field of *Portfolio Management*.
- I am very keen on programming languages and I often find myself playing with a new language trying to improve my skills; this has made me focused on *Functional Programming*, experimenting with languages such as *Ocaml* and *Haskell*.
- *Cryptanalysis* is another field that I find fascinating. I spent some time studying *Lattice Theory* and its implications regarding *Elliptic Curve* and *Post Quantum Cryptography*.




## Competitive Sports
- I have more than ten years of sailing activity at both national and international level in *Optimist*, *420*, and *470* classes, most of which among the ranks of the Junior National Team. I competed in several prestigious regattas, above all *Kiel Week* and *Barcolana* as the two largest sailing events in the world.
    - **`NATIONAL`** Ranked first once and qualified among the first ten Italian Juniors other four times. Notably, winner of the *Young Barcolana*, *Mediterranean Cup* and *Trofeo Accademia Navale Juniores*.
    - **`INTERNATIONAL`** Competed, as a member of the Italian National Team, in one *World Championship* in Qingdao (China), three *European Championships* in Tavira (Portugal), Dublin (Ireland), and Riva del Garda (Italy), and finished as runner-up in one *European Team Championship* in Berlin (Germany).
- As a side activity, I have practiced running at a discrete level, participating in several 10km and half-marathons. I have also took part in a few long-distance races, such as the *Etna Marathon* at over 3000m above sea level.
